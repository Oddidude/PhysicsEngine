# Physics Engine

This is my attempt to write a basic physics engine from scratch in C++.

The main goal of this project is to learn and master C++ and the SDL2 graphics library.


# Inspiration

The initial goal of this project was to learn C++ through making a game as I believe that creating games is a fun way to learn programming practices in new languages. Whilst thinking of game ideas, I started to think more and more about the way interactions would be handled in the game, such as collisions and gravity, and these thoughts lead me to the decision to create my own physics engine from scratch.
 
 
# Dependencies

The SDL2 library is not included in this repository so if you want to use it, you will have to download the packages yourself.
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).
